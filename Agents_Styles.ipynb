Its significance lies in its ability to:\n\n**1. Drive Interoperability and Reduce Integration Complexity:**\n\n*   **Common Language:** Open APIs provide a standardized way for different systems, even those from different vendors, to communicate with each other.  Think of it like everyone speaking the same language instead of needing translators for every conversation.\n*   **Reduced Integration Costs:** By adhering to a common standard, businesses avoid the expensive and time-consuming process of building custom integrations for each new system. This significantly lowers integration costs and accelerates deployment.\n*   **Plug-and-Play Functionality:** The standardized nature of Open APIs allows for easier integration of new components and services, creating a more \"plug-and-play\" environment.\n\n**2. Enable Business Agility and Innovation:**\n\n*   **Faster Time to Market:** The reduced integration effort allows businesses to quickly launch new products and services.  They can focus on innovation rather than wrestling with complex system integration.\n*   **Ecosystem Development:** Open APIs encourage the development of a broader ecosystem of partners and vendors.  Companies can easily integrate third-party solutions and services, fostering collaboration and innovation.\n*   **Flexibility and Scalability:** Open APIs provide the flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements and scale operations efficiently.  New capabilities can be added or modified without disrupting existing systems.\n\n**3. Facilitate Digital Transformation:**\n\n*   **Embrace Digital Technologies:** Open APIs are essential for businesses undergoing digital transformation.  They provide the foundation for connecting legacy systems with modern cloud-based platforms, mobile applications, and other digital channels.\n*   **Data-Driven Decision Making:** APIs can expose valuable data from various systems, enabling businesses to gain insights, improve operational efficiency, and make better-informed decisions.\n*   **Improved Customer Experience:** By integrating different systems, businesses can create a more seamless and personalized customer experience across all touchpoints.\n\n**4. Improve Efficiency and Automation:**\n\n*   **Streamlined Operations:** Open APIs enable automation of key business processes, such as order management, billing, and customer service. This reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and speeds up turnaround times.\n*   **Self-Service Capabilities:** APIs can be used to expose functionality to customers, allowing them to manage their accounts, order new services, and troubleshoot issues without human intervention.\n*   **Enhanced Partner Collaboration:** Open APIs make it easier for businesses to collaborate with partners on various activities, such as sales, marketing, and service delivery.\n\n**5. Vendor Neutrality and Competition:**\n\n*   **Reduced Vendor Lock-in:** Open APIs reduce dependence on specific vendors by allowing businesses to easily switch between different solutions.\n*   **Increased Competition:** The standardized nature of Open APIs promotes competition among vendors, as businesses can choose the best solutions based on their specific needs.\n\n**In essence, TM Forum's Open API standard is a critical enabler for digital transformation, business agility, and innovation in the telecommunications and other industries. It fosters interoperability, reduces integration complexity, and allows businesses to focus on delivering value to their customers.**\n"},"metadata":{}}],"source":["display(Markdown(initial))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"OU5PUvxsR4EW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751512296904,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":72,"user":{"displayName":"Deraviyam Jacob","userId":"04968705710474640464"}},"outputId":"2ac5fd3d-ff0e-4cbd-caa1-d735f32b5f1b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"This is a good overview of TM Forum Open APIs.

Knowing the audience will inform the level of technical detail and the tone.  Is it for business executives, technical managers, or developers?\n*   **Executive Summary (Even Shorter):** While you have a concluding paragraph, consider an even shorter introductory sentence or two that quickly highlights the *key* benefit.  For example: \"TM Forum Open APIs are a crucial standard that accelerates digital transformation and business agility by simplifying system integration and fostering innovation within the telecommunications industry.\" This immediately grabs attention.\n*   **Bullet Point Consistency:** Maintain consistency in the way you present your points. Sometimes you use phrases, sometimes full sentences.\n*   **Avoid Redundancy:** Look for repetitive phrases. For example, in nearly every section you mention \"business,\" \"systems,\" and \"integration.\" See where you can consolidate or rephrase.\n*   **Visual Hierarchy:**  While you have heading levels, consider adding visual elements to further break up the text.  For example, a simple icon next to each major point (e.g., a puzzle piece for interoperability, a gear for automation) can make it more visually appealing and easier to scan.\n*   **Call to Action (Optional):** Depending on the purpose of this response, consider adding a call to action. For example, \"Learn more about TM Forum Open APIs at [link]\" or \"Contact us to discuss how Open APIs can benefit your business.\"\n\n**II. Specific Content Improvements:**\n\n*   **Introductory Paragraph Enhancement:**  Expand slightly on *why* this standard is needed.  What problems were they trying to solve? (e.g., the siloed nature of telco systems, difficulty in integrating new technologies, the desire to create a digital ecosystem).\n*   **Deeper Dive into Interoperability (Section 1):**\n    *   **Data Models:** Briefly mention that Open APIs also define common data models, which are critical for true interoperability. It's not just the communication protocol, but also understanding the *meaning* of the data being exchanged.\n    *   **Specific Examples:**  Instead of just \"different systems,\" give concrete examples of systems that need to interoperate in telco:  \"Billing systems, CRM, network management systems, order entry systems...\"\n*   **Business Agility and Innovation (Section 2):**\n    *   **Microservices Architecture:**  Explicitly connect Open APIs to microservices.  They are a key enabler for building loosely coupled, independent services.\n*   **Facilitate Digital Transformation (Section 3):**\n    *   **Expand on \"Digital Channels\":** Examples like IoT, Smart Homes, Connected Cars.\n    *   **Real-time Insights:**  Instead of just \"data-driven decision making\", emphasize the *real-time* nature of the data and insights that Open APIs enable. This is key for modern business.\n*   **Improve Efficiency and Automation (Section 4):**\n    *   **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Mention the role of Open APIs in enabling RPA by providing accessible interfaces to automate repetitive tasks across different systems.\n*   **Vendor Neutrality and Competition (Section 5):**\n    *   **Reduce TCO:**  Mention that vendor neutrality ultimately reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by increasing negotiating power and avoiding proprietary lock-in.\n*   **Industry Specifics (Consider Adding):**\n    *   Although you mention telco, consider adding examples of other industries using the APIs (e.g., smart cities, energy, transportation). This will broaden the appeal of the explanation.\n    *   **Real-World Examples (Powerful):** Try to incorporate a brief, anonymized case study or example of a company successfully using Open APIs to achieve a specific business outcome (e.g., faster order provisioning, improved customer service response times).\n*   **Security:** Consider a separate section or bullet point on API security. This is a critical consideration, especially when exposing sensitive data. Mention aspects like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.\n\n**III. Enhanced Wording and Tone:**\n\n*   **Replace Generic Phrases:** Replace phrases like \"Think of it like...\" with more professional and specific analogies.\n*   **Avoid Jargon (Unless Necessary):** While \"interoperability\" is important, make sure you define it implicitly through your explanations.  Avoid unnecessary technical terms if your audience isn't deeply technical.\n*   **Use Action Verbs:** Start bullet points with strong action verbs (e.g., \"Accelerate time to market,\" \"Empower data-driven decisions\").\n*   **Replace Passive Voice:** Look for instances of passive voice and rewrite them in active voice.\n*   **Stronger Conclusion:** The conclusion is a little weak. End with a more compelling statement that emphasizes the transformative power of TM Forum Open APIs and their impact on the future of the telecommunications industry.\n\n**Example incorporating some improvements:**\n\n**TM Forum Open APIs: Accelerating Digital Transformation in Telecommunications**\n\nTM Forum Open APIs are a crucial set of interface definitions designed to eliminate the complexities of integrating disparate systems in the telecommunications industry.

Instead of explicitly writing code (Software 1.0) or curating datasets for models to learn (Software 2.0), Software 3.0 focuses on prompting, fine-tuning, and curating the *environment* in which the AI agent operates.  It's about creating systems where the intelligence is largely embedded in the model's learned parameters, with minimal explicit code.\n","\n","*   **Key Characteristics:**\n","\n","    *   **Data-Driven:** Heavily relies on vast amounts of data for training and adaptation.\n","    *   **Implicit Programming:**  The \"program\" is largely implicit, residing within the model's weights, rather than explicit code.\n","    *   **Emergent Behavior:** Complex behaviors emerge from the model's training, often in ways that are difficult to predict or fully understand.\n","    *   **Prompt Engineering/Environmental Design:**  Crucial for guiding the AI agent's behavior and shaping its interactions with the world.\n","    *   **Continuous Learning:** Designed to continuously learn and adapt from new data and experiences.\n","    *   **Agent-Based:**  Often involves AI agents interacting with environments, making decisions, and learning from the consequences of those decisions.\n","\n","*   **Differences from Software 1.0 and 2.0:**\n","\n","    *   **Software 1.0 (Classical Programming):**  Relies on explicitly written code, algorithms, and data structures.  Deterministic and predictable.\n","    *   **Software 2.0 (Machine Learning):**  Involves training models on curated datasets.  The \"program\" is the trained model, but the development process still heavily relies on data engineering and model selection.\n","    *   **Software 3.0:** Moves further away from explicit code and data engineering. The focus shifts to prompting, fine-tuning, and designing the environment for AI agents to learn and operate.  The knowledge is primarily embedded in the model itself. Think of it as coding the *environment* instead of coding the *logic*.\n","\n","*   **Potential Benefits:**\n","\n","    *   **Solving Complex Problems:**  Capable of tackling problems that are too complex or poorly defined for traditional programming approaches.\n","    *   **Adaptability and Generalization:**  Can adapt to changing environments and generalize to new situations more easily than traditional software.\n","    *   **Automation:** Automates tasks that previously required human intelligence.\n","    *   **Increased Productivity:**  Can potentially lead to faster development cycles and increased developer productivity.\n","\n","*   **Potential Drawbacks:**\n","\n","    *   **Lack of Transparency and Explainability:**  Difficult to understand how and why the model makes certain decisions.\n","    *   **Bias and Fairness Concerns:**  Models can inherit biases from the training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n","    *   **Security Risks:**  Vulnerable to adversarial attacks and other security threats.\n","    *   **Computational Resources:** Requires significant computational resources for training and deployment.\n","    *   **Control and Debugging:** Difficult to control and debug emergent behaviors.\n","    *   **Prompt Dependence:** Behavior is heavily dependent on the quality of the prompts. Poorly designed prompts can lead to unexpected and undesirable results.\n","\n","Now that I have this understanding of Software 3.0, I'm ready to move on to gathering information about McKinsey's view on AI Agents.\n","```python\n","from googlesearch import search\n","\n","query = \"McKinsey AI Agents\"\n","\n","try:\n","    results = list(search(query, lang=\"en\"))[:5] # Limit to the first 5 results\n","    for result in results:\n","        print(result)\n","except Exception as e:\n","    print(f\"An error occurred during the search: {e}\")\n","```\n","Run this code and provide the URLs.\n","\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Next speaker: Executor\n","\n","\n",">>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\n","Executor (to chat_manager):\n","\n","exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\n","Code output: \n","https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-an-ai-agent\n","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/why-agents-are-the-next-frontier-of-generative-ai\n","https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-promise-and-the-reality-of-gen-ai-agents-in-the-enterprise\n","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage\n","https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/healthcare-blog/what-are-ai-agents-and-what-can-they-do-for-healthcare\n","\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n",">>>>>>>> TERMINATING RUN (d416fcb3-7f35-4e0c-aa57-bc41b7a4a3d1): Maximum rounds (10) reached\n"]}],"source":["groupchat_result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(\n","    manager,\n","    message=task,\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qnQ1F3v7R4Ee"},"source":["# **Multi-Agent Pattern**\n","\n","<img src=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/content/images/2024/01/simple_multi_agent_diagram--1-.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Reflection Image\">"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":45,"metadata":{"id":"_jYO3UTzR4Ef","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751519321603,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Deraviyam Jacob","userId":"04968705710474640464"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import autogen"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":46,"metadata":{"id":"W_URrAhgR4Ef","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751519322807,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Deraviyam Jacob","userId":"04968705710474640464"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["llm_config = {\n","    \"model\": \"gemini-2.0-flash\",  # Specify your desired Gemini model\n","    \"api_key\": \"AIzaSyCpWj5A1LrMmAp8uS7fgIS0rqQdfFSw5uM\",  # Optional if using default authentication\n","    \"api_type\": \"google\"\n","}"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":47,"metadata":{"id":"inZVaPEFR4Ef","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751519327632,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":141,"user":{"displayName":"Deraviyam Jacob","userId":"04968705710474640464"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["ProductOwner = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n","    name=\"ProductOwner\",\n","    system_message=\"A human admin.

Daily stand-ups and regular check-ins can help.\n","*   **Testing Environment:**  A dedicated test environment that mirrors the production environment is essential for thorough testing.\n","*   **Definition of Done:**  The team needs to agree on a clear \"Definition of Done\" for the user story to ensure that all necessary tasks are completed before the story is considered finished.\n","*   **Incrementality:**  If the user story is too large, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n","*   **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling is critical for a production-ready API.\n","*    **Security**: Consider security when designing the endpoint. Ensure proper authentication and authorization are in place. Also, sanitize any inputs to prevent injection attacks.\n","\n","**Now, let's iterate based on feedback from the Product Owner and Tester.**  I'll provide example feedback and revisions.  After that, you can provide your own feedback, and I will revise the plan accordingly until you (as the Product Owner) approve it.\n","\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Next speaker: ProductOwner\n","\n","Replying as ProductOwner.

Since you said \"this is good,\" I'll assume that, as the Product Owner, you're generally happy with the initial plan. However, to be a good Scrum Master, I want to proactively anticipate potential feedback and make the plan even more robust. Here are some *potential* feedback points and how I'd revise the plan to address them.  Remember, this is me *guessing* what you or the Tester might say.  After these examples, you'll give me your actual feedback.\n","\n","**Potential Feedback Scenario 1: Product Owner wants more control over the \"newness\" of products.**\n","\n","*   **Product Owner Feedback:** \"I'm concerned that 'recent' is vague. I want to be able to define how many days back we consider a product 'new'. Can we add a configuration option for that?\"\n","\n","*   **Revised Plan:**\n","\n","    *   **Step 1 (Refine User Story & Acceptance Criteria):**  The Product Owner adds a requirement to allow configuration of the \"newness\" window (e.g., \"The number of days to consider a product 'new' should be configurable via an environment variable or application setting.\").  The acceptance criteria are updated to reflect this.\n","    *   **Step 3 (Code Implementation):** The Developer modifies the code to read the \"newness\" window configuration from an environment variable or application setting.\n","    *   **Step 7 (Functional Testing):** The Tester verifies that the \"newness\" window is configurable and that the endpoint returns the correct products based on the configured window.  This includes testing with different window values (e.g., 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 0 days).\n","\n","**Potential Feedback Scenario 2: Tester is concerned about performance with a large number of products.**\n","\n","*   **Tester Feedback:** \"I'm worried about the performance of this endpoint when we have a very large number of products in the database.  How will we ensure it scales?\"\n","\n","*   **Revised Plan:**\n","\n","    *   **Step 2 (Database Design):** The Developer *must* add an index on the `creation_date` (or equivalent) column in the `products` table. This is *critical* for performance.\n","    *   **Step 10 (Performance Testing):**  The Tester will specifically focus on performance testing with a large dataset.  We'll define a specific target number of products (e.g., 1 million) and measure the response time under load.  We'll also need to monitor database performance (e.g., query execution time, resource utilization).  The acceptance criteria for performance will be more specific (e.g., \"The endpoint should return results in under 500ms when the database contains 1 million products and is under moderate load.\").  This might involve using tools like JMeter or LoadView.\n","\n","**Potential Feedback Scenario 3: Tester wants to test error conditions more thoroughly**\n","\n","*   **Tester Feedback:** \"I'd like to test more error conditions, like what happens if the database is temporarily unavailable or if the query times out.\"\n","\n","*   **Revised Plan:**\n","\n","    *   **Step 7 (Functional Testing):** The Tester will add specific test cases to simulate database unavailability and query timeouts. This might involve temporarily disconnecting the API from the database or introducing artificial delays in the database query. The expected behavior (e.g., returning a 500 error with a meaningful message) will be documented in the test cases.\n","\n","**Now it's your turn.**  Based on the initial plan and the *potential* feedback I've outlined above, what specific feedback do you have *as the Product Owner*?
